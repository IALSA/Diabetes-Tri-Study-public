## Abstract  
The importance of preventing and controlling both **hypertension** (HTN) and **diabetes** mellitus (DM) to mitigate risks to physical health has long been understood by healthcare professionals. More recently, a growing body of evidence also implicates HTN and DM in age-related **cognitive decline** and risk for dementia, though consensus has yet to be reached on which cognitive domains are most vulnerable or whether older adults living with comorbid HTN and DM are at heightened risk for cognitive impairment. The present study sought to bring synthesis to this topic through the **coordinated analysis** of three longitudinal studies of aging. Identical multilevel linear growth models were fit to each study to estimate the impact of baseline disease status on verbal **episodic memory** level and change in late-life. Our findings suggest that independent and comorbid HTN and DM are differentially associated with verbal **episodic memory** and that these associations are context-dependent. The direction of estimates for the association between independent HTN and change in performance were mixed across studies. In only one study were independent DM and comorbid HTN and DM significantly related to performance. Given this, we recommend that future work explicitly differentiate between individuals diagnosed with HTN and/or DM through exclusion or model adjustment to avoid introducing confounds to results. Future coordinated analyses will help to disentangle the impacts of various social and contextual factors on the relation between **cardiovascular disease risk factors** and changes in **cognitive functioning**.
